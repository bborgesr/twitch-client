## A minimal twitch client

### Running the app (locally)

To run the app locally, clone/download it and then `cd` into it. Assuming that Node/`npm` is installed, all you need to do is:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the client and server are compiled, the app is ready at http://localhost:3000/

### Stack
For this app, I'm using React and Next.js (and a few other libraries, such as `express` and `isomorphic-unfetch`, as needed). 
I don't have any previous hands-on experience with either React or Next.js. However, I found this the ideal opportunity to 
explore React by doing. (I was already familiar with many of its concepts and theory). Additionaly, I chose to supplement 
React with Next.js after some [exploration of recommended toolchains](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). 
Next.js offered a [quick tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/) and provides some utilities like easy client and server routing 
that I found helpful.
